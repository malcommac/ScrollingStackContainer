### ⚠️ THE FOLLOWING LIBRARY WAS ARCHIVED. YOU CAN USE [ScrollStackController](https://github.com/malcommac/ScrollStackController)

`ScrollingStackContainer` is an efficient scrolling `UIStackView` replacement, more suitable in situations when you are building a scrolling container with an heterogeneous number of items.
It allows you to stack vertically `UIViewController` instances where the view is a simple fixed-height `UIView` or a `UICollectionView` or `UITableView`.

## Motivation
A full article about the motivation behind this class [is available on Medium](https://medium.com/@danielemargutti/efficient-scrolling-uistackview-in-swift-99f3d75fb12e) (or in my [personal blog](http://danielemargutti.com/2017/06/09/efficient-scrolling-uistackview-in-swift/)). Check it here for full details about how the class works.

UITableView and UICollectionView are great when you need to display a number of relatively simple cells; when your layout became complex you may need to create different UIViewController which manages each different kind layout.
These view controller may contains simple fixed-height `UIView` or complex `UICollectionView`/`UITableView`; in these cases you need to be careful because expading your scrollviews will destroy internal iOS caching mechanism.
`ScrollingStackContainer` allows you to stack view controllers easily without any worry; it manages view controllers with scrolling collections automatically in order to reduce the amount of memory usage.

## How to use it

It's very simple to implement: for **fixed height views** you should set a valid `height` (grater than zero). This can be done in your `UIViewController`'s subclass in one of the following ways:

* set an height constraint on `UIViewController`’s .view
* … or return a value into `preferredContentSize()` function
* … or set the height via `self.frame`
* … or by implementing the `StackContainable` protocol and returning `.view(height: <height>)` with a valid value.

For view controllers which **contains inner’s scroll views** (for example table or collections) you need to implement the `StackContainble` protocol by returning `.scroll(<inner scroll instance>, <insets of the inner scroll in superview>)`.

After that you should simply set the `viewControllers` property of your `ScrollingStackContainer` subclass:

```swift
	// view controller's view are stacked vertically in order
	self.viewControllers = [controller_2,controller_1,controller_3]
```

That’s all! All the business logic is managed by the class and you can enjoy!

See the example in this repository to get a live preview!

The following example is a vertical stack which contains a fixed height view controller, a view controller with a table inside and another fixed height controller.

## Installation

`ScrollingStackContainer` supports multiple methods for installing the library in a project.

## Installation with CocoaPods

[CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) is a dependency manager for Objective-C, which automates and simplifies the process of using 3rd-party libraries like `ScrollingStackContainer` in your projects. You can install it with the following command:

```bash
$ gem install cocoapods
```

#### Podfile

To integrate ScrollingStackContainer into your Xcode project using CocoaPods, specify it in your `Podfile`:

```ruby
source 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git'
platform :ios, '8.0'

target 'TargetName' do
use_frameworks!
pod 'ScrollingStackContainer', '~> 0.5'
end
```

Then, run the following command:

```bash
$ pod install
```

### Installation with Carthage

[Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) is a decentralized dependency manager that builds your dependencies and provides you with binary frameworks.

You can install Carthage with [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) using the following command:

```bash
$ brew update
$ brew install carthage
```

To integrate ScrollingStackContainer into your Xcode project using Carthage, specify it in your `Cartfile`:

```ogdl
github "malcommac/ScrollingStackContainer" ~> 0.5
```

Run `carthage` to build the framework and drag the built `ScrollingStackContainer.framework` into your Xcode project.

## Requirements

Current version is compatible with:

* Swift 3.1+
* iOS 8 or later
